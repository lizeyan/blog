# Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process:

1.  Mining all frequent itemsets.
2.  Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets.



A itemset X is closed if there is no proper super-set Y such that Y has the same support count as X.

A itemset X is a closed frequent itemset if X is frequent and closed.

A itemset X is a maximal frequent if X is frequent and there is no proper super-set Y such that Y is frequent.



## Frequent Itemset Mining Methods

### Apriori

Generate candidates and test if they are frequent. 

The key is pruning the search space.

The Apriori property: If a itemset is not frequent, then any superset of it is not frequent.

The procedure of Apriori algorithm:

1.  generate length-$k$ candidates based on length-$(k-1)$ frequent itemsets.
2.  Scan the database once and prune the infrequent length-$k$ candidates.

#### Improve the Efficiency of Apriori

1.  Hash-based technique
    Hash the itemsets into buckets. If a candidate's corresponding bucket count is below the support threshold, then we need not to test it. It is especially useful when $k=2$.
2.  Transaction reduction
    A transaction does not contain any length-$k$ frequent itemset, cannot contain any length-$(k+1)$ frequent itemset.
3.  Partitioning
    Partition the search space into some subspaces. Any global frequent itemset must be local frequent itemset in at least one subspace (with support threshold in subspace changed)
4.  Sampling.
5.  Dynamic itemset counting
