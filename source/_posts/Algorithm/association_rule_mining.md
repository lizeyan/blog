# Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process:

1.  Mining all frequent itemsets.
2.  Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets.



A itemset X is closed if there is no proper super-set Y such that Y has the same support count as X.

A itemset X is a closed frequent itemset if X is frequent and closed.

A itemset X is a maximal frequent if X is frequent and there is no proper super-set Y such that Y is frequent.
