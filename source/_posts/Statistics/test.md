## Two-Sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test

Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test may be used to test whether two underlying one-dimentional probability distributions differ.

In this case, the KS statistic is 
$$
D_{m,n}=\max_{x} |F_{1,n}(x)-F_{2,m}|,
$$
where $F_{1,n}$ and $F_{2,m}$ are the empirical distribution functions of
