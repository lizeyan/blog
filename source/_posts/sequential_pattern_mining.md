# Sequential Pattern Mining

## Sequence

A sequence is an ordered list of itemsets.

$\alpha$ is called a subseuquence of $\beta$, denoted as $\alpha \subseteq \beta$, if there exist indices $1\le j_1 \le j_2 \le ... \le j_n\le m$, such that $\alpha_1 \subseteq b_{j_1}, ...., a_n\subseteq b_{j_n}$.

| SID  | Sequence                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| 1    | <{a}, {a,b,c},{a,c},{d}, {c,f}> |
| 2    | <{a,d},{c},{b,c},{a,e}>         |
| 3    | <{e,f},{a,b},{d,f},{c},{b}>     |
| 4    |                                 |
