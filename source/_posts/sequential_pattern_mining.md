# Sequential Pattern Mining

## Sequence

A sequence is an ordered list of itemsets.

$\alpha$ is called a subseuquence of $\beta$, denoted as $\alpha \subseteq \beta$, if there exist indices $1\le j_1 \le j_2 \le ... \le j_n\le m$, such that $\alpha_1 \subseteq b_{j_1}, ...., a_n\subseteq b_{j_n}$.
