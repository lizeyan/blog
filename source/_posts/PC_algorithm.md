# PC Algorithm

## Find the Equivalence Class of a DAG

### Concepts and Notations

#### Faithfulness

A probability distribution $P$ is said to be faithful with respect to a graph $G$, if conditional independencies of the distribution can be inferred from **d-seperation** in the graph $G$ and vice-visa. More precisely, consider a random vector $\mathbf{X}\sim P$. Faithfulness of $P$ with respect to $G$ means, for any $i\ne j\in V$ and any set $\mathbf{s}\in V$,

$$
\mathbf{X}^{(i)}\bot \mathbf{X}^{(j)}\ \text{given} \ \mathbf{s}
\\\leftrightarrow\\
i\ \text{and}\ j \text{are d-seperated by the set}\ s
$$
