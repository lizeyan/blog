title: Locality Sensitive Hashing
---

## Definition and Instances

LSH is a randomized hasing framework for efficient approximate neasrest negibot search in high dimensional space.

It is based on the definition of LSH family $\mathcal{H}$, a family of hash functions mapping similar input items into the same hash code with higher probability than dissimilar items.

### The Family

A family $\mathcal{H}$ is $(R, cR, P_1, P_2)$-sensitive if for any two items $p$ and $q$:
$$
P(h(p))
$$
